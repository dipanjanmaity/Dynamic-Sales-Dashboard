# :chart_with_upwards_trend: E Commerce Sales Dashboard


In this work I built an Interactive Dynamic Dashboard in Excel using Pivot Features, tables & slicers.
This dashboard tells story about transactional historical data from 2015 to 2017. There are total 20,778 transactions. The data is contained in three worksheets and lookuped into one worksheet to create this analysis.

A web-based retailer wants to create a sales dashboard to analyse sales based on different product categories.For profit, revenue, quantity, cost of goods sold, and transaction, the corporation wishes to introduce user control. Users can thus choose settings and view the trend by month.
