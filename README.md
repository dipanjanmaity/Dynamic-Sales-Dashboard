# Dynamic-Sales-Dashboard using MS EXCEL


A sales dashboard centralizes, standardizes, and visually represents all sales data in an easily accessible platform. A sales dashboard provides transparency into different sales KPIs, enabling sales teams and managers to assess performance against their goals and objectives in real time.

In this work I built an Interactive Dynamic Dashboard in Excel
using Power Query, Pivot Features, tables & slicers.
